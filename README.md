# 📄 Multi-Part Input Distribution

Transform a single input into **multiple outputs** — PDFs, audio (MP3), images, and more.  
This project demonstrates a pipeline that accepts an uploaded PDF, extracts text, and generates a summarized output using Google Gemini. The architecture is modular so you can add audio, image generation, or streaming later.

## 🔖 One-liner
**Split one input into many outputs — PDFs, MP3s, images, and more.**

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload a PDF and extract raw text.
- Summarize the content using Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`).
- Return the summary as JSON.
- Modular design to support additional outputs (audio, images, video).

## 🧠 Inspiration
Different people prefer different mediums — reading, listening, or viewing. This project was inspired by the idea of making the same content accessible across multiple formats simultaneously.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (API routes / serverless functions)  
- **Parsing**: [pdf-parse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-parse)  
- **AI**: [Google GenAI](https://ai.google.dev) (Gemini models)  
- **Runtime**: Node.js

## 🛠️ How it works
1. Upload a PDF via a form request.  
2. Convert the uploaded file into a buffer.  
3. Extract text using `pdf-parse`.  
4. Send the extracted text to Gemini for summarization.  
5. Return a clean JSON response.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:
```console
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```
2. Install dependencies:
```console
npm install
```
3. Add your environment variable in `.env.local`:
```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
4.Run the development server
```console
npm run dev
```

## 🎉 Accomplishments
- Built a system that transforms one input into multiple outputs.  
- Successfully demonstrated PDF → Text → AI Summary.  
- Designed modular architecture for extending into audio, images, and video.

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Large PDFs and memory optimization.  
- Summarization accuracy and prompt tuning.  
- Handling quirks of different formats (PDF layout vs. audio pronunciation).  

---

## 📚 What we learned
- Working with multiple content formats in one pipeline.  
- How to integrate AI models into serverless functions.  
- The importance of accessibility-first design.  

---

## 🔭 Roadmap
- Add **text-to-speech (MP3)** output.  
- Add **image/diagram generation** from extracted text.  
- Support **video narration** and **real-time streaming**.  
- Integrate with **cloud storage** (Google Drive, S3).  
- Provide a **UI for uploads & downloads**.
---
## 🎯 Goals

- Make one input accessible across **multiple formats** (PDF, audio, images).
- Improve **accessibility** for people with different needs (visual, auditory, cognitive).
- Enable **low-bandwidth** and **offline-friendly** distribution (smaller, targeted outputs).
- Provide **education-ready** content (summaries, study notes, slides).
- Offer **plug-and-play modules** so others can extend the pipeline (TTS, diagrams, video).
- Keep it **open-source**, documented, and easy to adopt.

## 🌍 How this fits: AI for Good — Helping Humanity

- **Accessibility & Inclusion:** Converts the same content into formats that serve screen-reader users, language learners, and people on the go.
- **Equity of Access:** Lowers friction for communities with constrained devices or connectivity by generating lightweight alternatives (text, compressed audio).
- **Education & Literacy:** Produces clear summaries and multimodal learning aids that support students and lifelong learners.
- **Crisis & Public Info:** Supports rapid reformatting of guidance (health, safety, disaster updates) into readable, audible, and visual versions.
- **Sustainable Use of AI:** Promotes **right-sized** outputs (only what’s needed, when it’s needed) to reduce unnecessary compute and storage.
